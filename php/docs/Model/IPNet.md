## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**iP** | **int[]** | Note that in this documentation, referring to an IP address as an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address is a semantic property of the address, not just the length of the byte slice: a 16-byte slice can still be an IPv4 address. | [optional] 
**mask** | **int[]** |  | [optional]
